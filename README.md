# FHA Housing and Mortgage Data

On September 23, 2019, FHFA posted on its website an interim release of data for 2018 through its Public Use Database (PUDB), pending an update based on receipt of additional data fields that reflect new 2018 reporting requirements under HMDA.

The original data file (Public Use National A) contains 2,953,035 records showing all single-family home mortgages acquired during 2018 by Fannie Mae (1,750,272) and Freddie Mac (1,202,763). This data has been reduced to a sample of 10,000 records for ease of analysis.

* Final Report: https://www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/Pages/Annual-Housing-Report-2019.aspx

The data in the FHFA PUDB is very similar to another nationally-representative survey dataset published each year by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The NAR dataset is proprietary and must be purchased for further analysis, but a summary report is available for free on their website.
